    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Grilled Cheese Sandwich is the ultimate comfort food, enjoyed in various forms across the world but most famously associated with American cuisine. At its core, it's simply bread and cheese, pan-fried in butter until the outside is golden and crisp, and the inside is oozing with melted cheese. It’s often served with a bowl of tomato soup, making it a cozy and nostalgic meal — especially during cold weather or sick days. Its simplicity, affordability, and quick preparation have made it a staple in households, diners, and lunchboxes alike.</p>
    <p>What gives the grilled cheese its universal appeal is its versatility. While the classic version uses white bread and American or cheddar cheese, variations abound — adding tomatoes, herbs, bacon, or switching up the type of bread and cheese. Yet even in its most basic form, it's deeply satisfying. The buttery crunch of the toast pairs beautifully with the gooey, molten cheese inside. It's a reminder that sometimes the best dishes don't need complexity — just quality ingredients and the right amount of heat.</p>
