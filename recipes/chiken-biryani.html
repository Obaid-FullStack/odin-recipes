    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a fragrant and richly spiced dish that combines marinated chicken, aromatic basmati rice, and layers of spices, herbs, and fried onions. The preparation begins by marinating chicken pieces in yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, lemon juice, and salt. This mixture is set aside for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat. Meanwhile, basmati rice is rinsed and partially cooked with whole spices like bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon to infuse it with aroma.</p>
    <p>In a deep pot or handi, ghee or oil is heated, and thinly sliced onions are fried until golden brown and crisp — some of these are set aside for garnishing. The marinated chicken is added to the pot and cooked until tender. Then, the half-cooked rice is layered over the chicken, along with saffron-infused milk, mint leaves, coriander, and the reserved fried onions. The pot is sealed and cooked on low heat (dum) for about 20–30 minutes to let the flavors meld together. The result is a heavenly dish with tender chicken, perfectly spiced rice, and a mouthwatering aroma that makes biryani a timeless favorite.</p>
