    <h2 class="heading-2">Description</h2>
    <p>Margherita Pizza is one of the most iconic and beloved dishes to emerge from Italian cuisine. Known for its minimal ingredients and rich flavors, this pizza captures the essence of what makes Italian food so universally popular — simplicity, freshness, and balance. Traditionally made with just a thin crust, fresh tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil leaves, the Margherita is a tribute to the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Legend has it that this pizza was created in honor of Queen Margherita of Savoy in the 1880s, and it has remained a symbol of Italy ever since.</p>
    <p>What makes Margherita Pizza truly special is how a few basic ingredients come together to create something deeply satisfying. The thin crust offers a light, crispy base that allows the creamy mozzarella and tangy tomato sauce to shine. The addition of basil gives it a fresh, herbal finish that elevates each bite. It's often drizzled with a bit of olive oil before baking, enhancing the aroma and flavor. Despite the rise of heavily topped pizzas, Margherita remains a timeless favorite for those who appreciate classic, authentic taste.
